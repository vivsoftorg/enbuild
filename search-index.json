This tool simplifies the entire software development process, making it accessible and efficient for users with various technical backgrounds.\nGitHub Integration When working with GitHub, ENBUILD seamlessly communicates with the CI/CD provider through REST and GraphQL APIs. It starts by creating a Repository Project, essentially a structured workspace, using a template repository project. The user interacts with ENBUILD through an intuitive user interface (UI), providing inputs that guide the customization of files. These files are then updated based on the user\u0026rsquo;s preferences. Once the configuration is complete, ENBUILD executes the predefined workflow or pipeline, automating the deployment process without the need for intricate manual steps.\nGitLab Integration Similarly, when integrating with GitLab, ENBUILD initiates the process by creating a Repository Project within the GitLab environment. Just like with GitHub, the user\u0026rsquo;s inputs through the ENBUILD UI guide the customization of files within the project. ENBUILD updates these files accordingly, ensuring that the project aligns with the user\u0026rsquo;s specifications. Subsequently, the tool triggers the execution of the workflow or pipeline, seamlessly automating the development and deployment steps.\nIn essence, ENBUILD acts as a facilitator, taking the complexities out of setting up projects and workflows. It empowers users to customize their development environments through a straightforward UI, enabling a smooth and efficient interaction with CI/CD systems like GitHub and GitLab. The result is an accelerated and simplified software development process, allowing developers to focus on building innovative solutions without getting bogged down by technical intricacies.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":8,"permalink":"/docs/getting-started/how-enbuild-works/","summary":"ENBUILD operates as a bridge between developers and the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems, specifically with popular platforms like GitHub and GitLab.","tags":[],"title":"How ENBUILD works"},{"content":"Architecture Digram Frontend Service The ENBUILD frontend service provides the ENBUILD User Interface (UI) to the end user.\nBackend Service The ENBUILD backend service is responsible for integration with the CI/CD Provider.\nUser Service The ENBUILD user service manages the end-user\u0026rsquo;s state, such as authentication, access, API access and role-based access control.\nML Service The ENBUILD ML (Machine Learning) service enables data scientists to quickly create feature sets and deploy models.

While the Quick install of ENBUILD facilitates local testing through port forwarding, deploying in a production scenario demands a more robust approach. This document outlines various options available for exposing the ENBUILD UI service outside the Kubernetes cluster.\nOption 1: Expose UI using Kubernetes Service Type LoadBalancer Setting the service type to LoadBalancer enables external access to the ENBUILD UI service. Simply configure the service type as LB to allow external traffic. Refer to the example helm input file for guidance.\nOption 2: Use Service Type NodePort Configuring the service type as NodePort provides accessibility by exposing a specific port on all nodes in the cluster. Access the ENBUILD UI using the designated node port.\nRefer to the example helm input file for guidance.\nOption 3: Use Ingress Controller Installation and configuration of an Ingress controller within the Kubernetes cluster are prerequisites for this option. Expose the ENBUILD UI service through Ingress configuration for enhanced routing and management of external traffic. Refer to the example helm input file for guidance.\nOption 4: Expose Using Istio Virtual Service (Istio installation)[(docs/how-to-guides/installing-istio/)] and configuration are required for leveraging this option. Set the istio.enabled parameter to true and provide the necessary configurations, such as the Istio Virtual Service, to expose the ENBUILD UI service.

They can be assigned group membership by clicking on the Join Groups button or Groups tab from the profile.\nClick on the Add Member button and select the group you want to add the user to, then click on the Add button.\nExposing the KeyCloak service in Kubernetes. So far we have accessed the keycloak service from the browser by using the port-forwarding and then accessing it via local-port. But for production usage and to configure it as SSO inside ENBUILD we need to expose it on a public IP address.\nThere are multiple ways to achive that -\nExpose the keycloak-http service as LoadBalancer - This way the kubernertes will create a external loadbalancer and expose the service on a public IP address. Create an Ingress resource for the keycloak-http service - This way we can use a ingress controller to route traffic to the keycloak service based on the hostname. If you have istio deployed and configured in your cluster, then expose it as virtual service. This is the sample virtaul service configurations you can use ❗ Note: Make sure to adjust the hosts to the right value to which you want to expose the service.\nCreate a DNS record for the keycloak after you have exposed the keycloak-http service using any of the above methods, you can create a DNS record pointing to the public IP address or FQDN of the loadbalncer.\ne.g. if you have exposed the service using the istio virtual service you will need to create a DNS record for this service in your DNS provider.\nThe IP address of the DNS will be the EXTERNAL-IP of the istio-ingressgateway service, you can find that using the command below.\nkubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}\u0026#39; Create a DNS type A record using the IP address from the command above.\nOnce done you can proceed to configure keycloak as SSO for ENBUILD\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":21,"permalink":"/docs/how-to-guides/install-and-configure-keycloak-for-enbuild-sso/","summary":"Install and Configure Keycloak for ENBUILD SSO","tags":[],"title":"Install and Configure Keycloak for ENBUILD SSO"},{"content":"Overview This guide outlines the steps required to create a new catalog template repository in your GitHub or Gitlab account.\nPrerequisites You must have a GitHub and or Gitlab account and have access to the orgnizations you are part of.

These Catalog Items are meticulously crafted by developers to encapsulate pre-configured settings, best practices, and reusable components, providing users with a simplified and consistent approach to deploying complex infrastructure and applications.\nENBUILD Catalog Items are tailored to support a diverse range of use cases and technologies, including:\nTerraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Catalog Items for Terraform enable users to define and manage cloud infrastructure resources using Infrastructure as Code principles. These Catalog Items offer pre-defined templates and configurations for provisioning resources on popular cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, facilitating rapid deployment and automation of infrastructure provisioning tasks.\nKubernetes Distributions (e.g., Amazon EKS, Azure AKS): Catalog Items for Kubernetes distributions provide users with pre-configured templates for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters on various cloud providers, such as Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). These Catalog Items simplify the setup and configuration of Kubernetes clusters, enabling users to leverage the scalability and agility of Kubernetes for containerized application deployment and orchestration.\nHelm Deployments (e.g., Big Bang): Catalog Items for Helm deployments offer pre-packaged configurations and charts for deploying applications and services using Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. These Catalog Items streamline the deployment of complex applications by providing ready-to-use Helm charts and configurations, reducing the time and effort required for setting up and configuring application environments.\nBy leveraging ENBUILD Catalog Items, developers gain access to a curated library of templates and configurations that serve as starting points for their projects. These Catalog Items not only accelerate the development and deployment process but also promote consistency, reliability, and best practices across projects within the ENBUILD ecosystem.\nQ: What is an Version Control System (VCS)?\nA: A Version Control System (VCS) is a fundamental tool used in software development to manage and track changes to source code, configuration files, and other project assets over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project concurrently while maintaining a history of all modifications made to the project files.\nIn the context of ENBUILD, a Version Control System (VCS) plays a crucial role in managing and deploying ENBUILD Catalog Items, which are template projects designed to facilitate the deployment of infrastructure components and applications within the ENBUILD ecosystem. ENBUILD supports integration with popular VCS platforms such as GitLab and GitHub, providing users with the flexibility to version control their Catalog Items and streamline the deployment process.\nKey features and benefits of using a Version Control System (VCS) include:\nHistory Tracking: VCS systems maintain a detailed history of changes made to project files, including who made the changes and when they were made. This allows developers to review past revisions, track the evolution of the project, and revert to previous versions if necessary.\nCollaboration: VCS systems enable seamless collaboration among team members by providing mechanisms for sharing and synchronizing changes to project files. Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without risking conflicts or data loss.\nBranching and Merging: VCS systems support branching and merging workflows, allowing developers to create separate branches to work on specific features or fixes independently. Branches can later be merged back into the main codebase, ensuring a streamlined and organized development process.\nAuditing and Compliance: VCS systems offer auditing capabilities that help maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies. Organizations can track and monitor all changes made to project files, ensuring accountability and transparency in the development process.\nBy leveraging a Version Control System (VCS) such as GitLab or GitHub, ENBUILD users can effectively manage their Catalog Items, collaborate with team members, track changes, and maintain a consistent and reliable deployment workflow.\nChange Control Q: What is the Release schedule?\nA: To Be Determined. 📆\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":27,"permalink":"/docs/faq/frequently-asked-questions/","summary":"About Q: Who is behind this project?\nA: VivSoft! 🐘 VivSoft is focused on solving complex problems in the public sector using innovative technologies.","tags":[],"title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"content":"Glossary of terms\nTerm Definition DevSecOps This is a combination of development, security, and operations. Imagine a team working on creating a software, where everyone from programmers to security experts and IT professionals collaborate closely from the start to the end of a project. This approach ensures that the software is developed quickly, securely, and efficiently. Containerization Think of this as packing your entire software, with everything it needs to run (like code, libraries, and system tools), into a single package or \u0026lsquo;container\u0026rsquo;. This container can then be easily moved and run on different computers or servers, much like how you might pack your belongings into a suitcase when traveling, ensuring you have everything you need wherever you go. Kubernetes This is like a conductor for an orchestra, but instead of managing musical instruments, it manages containers (those packages mentioned earlier). Kubernetes helps in organizing and automating the deployment, scaling (adjusting the size or capacity), and management of containerized applications, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently. Helm Deployments Helm is akin to a package manager for Kubernetes. Just as you might use a tool on your computer to install, update, or manage software, Helm does this for Kubernetes applications. It works with packages called \u0026lsquo;charts\u0026rsquo;, which are collections of information necessary to create a standardized deployment on Kubernetes. This makes installing and managing Kubernetes applications as easy as installing apps on your smartphone. Terraform Infrastructure Deployments Terraform is a tool that allows you to describe your infrastructure (like servers, databases, and networks) using code. This approach lets you set up and manage your infrastructure through code files, which can be versioned, reused, and shared. Imagine building a model city where you can design and rearrange buildings, roads, and parks with a few clicks. Terraform does something similar for computer infrastructure, allowing for easy adjustments and replication across different environments. GitLab and GitHub Integration GitLab and GitHub are platforms that allow developers to store their code, track changes, and collaborate with others. Integrating with these platforms means ENBUILD can automatically interact with your code stored on GitLab or GitHub, helping automate parts of the development process like testing and deployment, much like how social media apps can share information to keep everything in sync. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) This is a practice in software development where every time a developer makes changes to the code (continuous integration), those changes are automatically tested and then deployed to the live application (continuous deployment). It\u0026rsquo;s like a factory assembly line for software, where new features are added, tested, and made available to users seamlessly and efficiently. NoSQL Database Unlike traditional databases that store data in tables, a NoSQL database uses a more flexible format (like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs). This flexibility allows for easier storage and retrieval of data in various formats, making it suitable for applications that handle diverse and large amounts of data, such as social networks or e-commerce sites. Helm Chart A Helm chart is a package containing all the necessary information to run an application or service on Kubernetes. It includes details on how the application should be configured and deployed, similar to a recipe that outlines the ingredients and steps needed to make a dish. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) RBAC is a method for restricting system access to authorized users. It\u0026rsquo;s like having different keys for different rooms in a building; depending on your role (e.g., manager, employee), you\u0026rsquo;re given keys (access) only to the areas you need to perform your job. Iron Bank Accredited Containers Iron Bank refers to a repository of secure container images that have been approved for use within certain secure environments, such as government or military. Think of it as a library of vetted, safe-to-use building blocks for software that meet high security standards. GitOps This is a way to manage your infrastructure and applications by using Git (a version control system) as the single source of truth. It\u0026rsquo;s like maintaining a detailed blueprint for a machine; any changes to the blueprint automatically update the machine, ensuring it always matches the design specifications. KubeFlow KubeFlow is a project aimed at making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable. Imagine if you could set up a complex scientific experiment with all its equipment and processes in a box, move it anywhere, and have it work the same way every time—that\u0026rsquo;s what KubeFlow does for ML projects. Landing Zones In cloud computing, a landing zone is a predefined environment with a set of policies, tools, and computing resources. It\u0026rsquo;s prepared ground for new applications or services, ensuring they have a secure and efficient place to operate from the moment they\u0026rsquo;re deployed. Service Mesh A service mesh is a layer that controls how different parts of an application share data with one another. It\u0026rsquo;s like a sophisticated system within a busy city that manages how cars (data) navigate the streets (network) to ensure smooth traffic flow and delivery of passengers (services) to their destinations safely and efficiently.

Big Bang packages are broken into three categories:\nCore: Core packages are a group of capabilities required by the DoD DevSecOps Reference Architecture, that are supported directly by the Big Bang development team. The specific capabilities that are considered core currently are Service Mesh, Policy Enforcement, Logging, Monitoring, and Runtime Security.\nAddons: Addon packages are any packages/capabilities that the Big Bang development team directly supports that do not fall under the above core definition. These serve to extend the functionality/features of Big Bang.\nCommunity: Community packages are any packages that are maintained by the broader Big Bang community (users, vendors, etc). These packages could be alternatives to core or addon packages, or even entirely new packages to help extend usage/functionality of Big Bang.\nIn order for an installation of Big Bang to be a valid installation/configuration you must install/deploy a core package of each category (for additional details on categories and options see here).\nBig Bang also builds tooling around the testing and validation of Big Bang packages. These tools are provided as-is, without support.\nBig Bang is intended to be used for deploying and maintaining a DoD hardened and approved set of packages into a Kubernetes cluster. Deployment and configuration of ingress/egress, load balancing, policy auditing, logging, monitoring, etc. are handled via Big Bang. Additional packages (e.g. ArgoCD, GitLab) can also be enabled and customized to extend Big Bang\u0026rsquo;s baseline. Once deployed, the Kubernetes cluster can be used to add mission specific applications.\nFurther Reading Read big bang Official Documentation Checkout big bang on GitHub ","date":"0001-01-01","id":30,"permalink":"/docs/references/platform-one-big-bang/","summary":"Big Bang is a declarative, continuous delivery tool for deploying DoD hardened and approved packages into a Kubernetes cluster.","tags":[],"title":"Platform One Big Bang"},{"content":" GitLab stands as a comprehensive DevOps platform, providing end-to-end solutions for source code management, continuous integration, delivery, security, and more.
