Follow these step-by-step instructions to deploy ENBUILD locally using Iron Bank images for testing.

## Prerequisites

### Existing Kubernetes Cluster

Ensure that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster and obtain the KubeConfig file.

You can use [rancher-desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/) or [k3d](../../references/k3d/) to spin up a local Kubernetes cluster.


### Helm CLI

The [Helm](https://helm.sh/) streamlines and automates Kubernetes deployments by managing charts, enabling users to easily package, version, and deploy complex applications.

### Access to ironbank

Vivsoft has released the ENBUILD Container images in [Ironbank](https://registry1.dso.mil/) in order to pull these images, you need to register in [Ironbank](https://registry1.dso.mil/) and create credentials.

## Deployment Steps:

Following are the steps you will need to take to deploy ENBUILD to your Kubernetes cluster.

### Add ENBUILD Helm Chart Repository

To add the ENBUILD Helm chart repository, run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add vivsoft https://vivsoftorg.github.io/enbuild

"vivsoft" has been added to your repositories
```

:exclamation: **Note:** If the helm repo is already present on you machine , update it to get the latest version

```bash
‚ùØ helm repo update vivsoft
```

### Configure ENBUILD Helm Values

Before deploying ENBUILD to the Kubernetes cluster, you will need to create a custom values.yaml file so that we can specify configurations unique to this deployment.

For local deployment however we require minimum deployment values.

:exclamation: **Note:** For more information about the complete set of ENBUILD Helm values click [here](/docs/getting-started/helm-values/)!

Refer to the [example helm input file to be used to pull images from IronBank](https://github.com/vivsoftorg/enbuild/blob/main/examples/enbuild/quick_install_ib.yaml) for guidance.

Make sure to replace the
REGISTRY1_USER_NAME and REGISTRY1_PASSWORD , with your registry1 credentials.
AppVersion with the ENBUILD application version you want to install. ( Make sure the images with the selected tags are present in IronBank)


### Deploy ENBUILD HELM Chart

Make sure you update the values input to reference the values you created in Step 2.
Execute the command below. Adjust the `--set global.AppVersion=1.0.21` to the version you want to deploy and ensure the `--version` matches the version of the chart you want to deploy.

```bash
helm upgrade --install --namespace enbuild enbuild vivsoft/enbuild --version 0.0.29 --create-namespace -f target/quick_install_ib.yaml --set global.AppVersion=1.0.22

Release "enbuild" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: enbuild
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Mar 22 17:37:23 2024
NAMESPACE: enbuild
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:3000 to use your application after starting the port forward"
  kubectl --namespace enbuild port-forward svc/enbuild-enbuild-ui 3000:80
```

### Validate ENBUILD Deployment

Use the following commands to validate the ENBUILD pods are up and running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n enbuild

NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS         AGE

```

:exclamation: **Note:** You might see restarts of the enbuild-enbuild-mq-\* pod until the RabbitMQ service is up and running.

**Validate the ENBUILD services are setup correctly**

```bash
kubectl get services -n enbuild

NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                 AGE

```

### Access ENBUILD

Use the port forwarding command to access the ENBUILD UI using your web browser.

```bash
kubectl --namespace enbuild port-forward svc/enbuild-enbuild-ui 3000:80

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:3000 -> 8080
```

Navigate your web browser to **http://127.0.0.1:3000**. and set the admin password.

After you set the initial admin password, you should see the ENBUILD home page with BigBang Catalog.
